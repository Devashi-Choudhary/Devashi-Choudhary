### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Devashi. A combination of a techie and creativity, I like to brew the two worlds together. Dreaming of having a world enriched by disruptive technology and visions of Artificial Intelligence and Data-Driven Algorithms shape the future of society. Diving into the ocean of Technology, I like to have my creative juice flowing into the stream to complete it with the right flavor of Hard-work and Dedication. Technology echoes a range of possibilities and I, manage to keep them satisfied and also save some time on my calendar for creativity and photography.
